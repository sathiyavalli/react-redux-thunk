# vacation-related-reactRedux-Project
This project is about to show the vacation related data that is fetched from API of github by using Redux, Thunk and async React fetch with pagination and filtering, sorting option.<br>

Used my github Api to store data."https://my-json-server.typicode.com/sathiyavalli/places/datas"<br>

React fetch for asyc operation and used reactRedux to create globalstate that can be used globally anywhere in the app by getting and storing the value in store.<br>

Used "react-pagination-list" for pagination<br>
